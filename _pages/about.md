Hello! I am a software developer who works closely with intelligent bots from Pakitan. I usually work with Natural Language Processing with low-code tools. 

Currently, I am more interested in trustworthy AI systems. 

Before starting my job in the industry, I pursued Computer Engineering and graduated with distinction. During my undergraduate school, I worked on a research project to develop an AI-driven solution for sustainable usage of electricity appliances.
